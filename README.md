# SwiftUI MVVM Example

A practical example demonstrating the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern in SwiftUI.

## About MVVM

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural pattern that originated from Microsoft for use with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight. It was introduced by John Gossman in 2005. The pattern separates an application into three main components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic
2. **View**: Displays the UI and handles user interactions
3. **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View, exposing data and commands for binding

Key benefits of MVVM include improved separation of concerns, better testability, and seamless integration with data-binding frameworks like SwiftUI where the ViewModel can automatically update the View when data changes.
